# Canvas Python Sample Repository
## Projects
This directory contains starter projects designed for developers to get started and build out larger applications on top of to meet their use case. Each subfolder in this directory defines a "project". Each project provides one (or several related) `.py` Python script files that can be copied to a device running Canvas firmware using the Xbit tools for VS Code extension.

Projects will indicate within their `README.md` file which Canvas hardware platforms they are compatible with/designed for. Note that some projects require specific hardware that may not be available on all devices.
