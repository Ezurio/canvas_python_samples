# AltBeacon Example

The `altbeacon_beacon.py` script provides an example starter project using the `altbeacon.py` module to implement an AltBeacon advertisement over BLE. This script was designed for use on any DVK or module with Bluetooth Low Energy support.

This script can be extended as your end application requires and is meant to serve as an easy way to get started advertising AltBeacon compliant beacons.
