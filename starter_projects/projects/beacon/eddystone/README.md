# Eddystone Beacon Examples

This folder contains several example starter projects that use the `eddystone.py` module and implement a specific type of Eddystone BLE advertisement format from the spec. These scripts were designed for use on any DVK or module with Bluetooth Low Energy support.

`eddystone_eid.py`: Implements an Eddystone EID beacon
`eddystone_tlm.py`: Implements an Eddystone TLM beacon
`eddystone_uid.py`: Implements an Eddystone UID beacon
`eddystone_url.py`: Implements an Eddystone URL beacon

These files can be extended as your end application requires, they are meant to serve as an easy way to get started advertising Eddystone compliant beacons.
