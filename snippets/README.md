# Canvas Python Sample Repository
## Snippets
This directory contains simplified Python script "snippets", intended to quickly familiarize developers with commonly used Canvas APIs. These snippets focus on code readability and are intentionally kept very simple to help with learning how to operate the Canvas compatible hardware functions from Python. Each snippet provides one (or several related) `.py` Python script files that can be directly installed to a device running Canvas firmware using the Xbit tools for VS Code extension.

Snippets will indicate within their `README.md` file which Canvas hardware platforms they are compatible with/designed for. Note that some snippets require specific hardware that may not be available on all devices.
